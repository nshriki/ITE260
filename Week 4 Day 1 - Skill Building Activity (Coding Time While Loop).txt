1. Create a program that will display 10 to 1 using a while loop.

> Code:

i = 10
while i >= 1:
    print(i)
    i = i - 1

> Output:

10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1



2. Create a program that accepts 5 integers then computes for the sum.

> Code:

print("Enter 5 numbers: ")
sum = 0
i = 1

while i <= 5:
    x = int(input(""))
    sum += x
    i += 1
print("Sum:", sum)

> Output:

Enter 5 numbers: 
21
33
56
77
9
Sum: 196



3. Objective: Create a while loop that counts from 1 to a specified number and prints each number.
Instructions: Ask the user to input a number. Use a while loop to count from 1 to the specified number. Inside the loop, print each number. Continue counting and printing until you reach the specified number.

> Code:

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
i = 1

while i <= num:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1

> Output:

Enter a number: 7
1
2
3
4
5
6
7



4. Objective: Use a while loop to print a message a specified number of times.
Instructions: Ask the user to input a message and the number of times they want it to be printed. Use a while loop to print the message the specified number of times. Increment a counter variable in each iteration to keep track of how many times the message has been printed. Exit the loop when the counter reaches the specified number.

> Code:

message = input("Enter a message: ")
num = int(input("Number of times the message to be printed: "))

i = 1

while i <= num:
    print("Count:", i)
    print(message)
    i = i + 1

> Output:

Enter a message: let's go ITE 260!
Number of times the message to be printed: 5
Count: 1
let's go ITE 260!
Count: 2
let's go ITE 260!
Count: 3
let's go ITE 260!
Count: 4
let's go ITE 260!
Count: 5
let's go ITE 260!



5. Objective: Create a simple word guessing game using a while loop.
Instructions: Choose a secret word and store it in a variable. Ask the player to guess the secret word. Use a while loop to repeatedly ask the player for their guess until they guess the correct word. Inside the loop, compare the player's guess to the secret word.
	â€¢ If the guess is incorrect, print a message like "Try again."
	â€¢ If the guess is correct, print a message like "Congratulations! You guessed the secret word!" and exit the loop.

> Code:

secretmsg = "enhypen"
i = 1

while i > 0:
    user = input("Guess the secret word: ")
    if user != secretmsg:
        print("Try again.")
    else:
        print("Congratulations! You guessed the secret word!")
        break

> Output:

Guess the secret word: enha
Try again.
Guess the secret word: enhaipeun
Try again.
Guess the secret word: enhypen
Congratulations! You guessed the secret word!
